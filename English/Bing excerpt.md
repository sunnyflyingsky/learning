## World Children's Day

For World Children's Day, we're featuring an aerial view of a larger-than-life painting next to the summit of the Moléson in the Swiss Prealps. The 16,000-square-foot fresco is titled 'Un Nouveau Souffle' (A New Breath) and depicts a child blowing clouds toward the horizon. It was created by French-Swiss artist Saype—real name Guillaume Legros—who is known for his grassy graffiti around the world. The eco-friendly artist uses biodegradable paints made from natural pigments such as coal and chalk, so by the time you read this, his land art will have already disappeared into the soil.

Saype's mountaintop mural aims to inspire childlike wonder, which is an apt message for World Children's Day. Though there are numerous Children's Day celebrations around the globe, and on varying dates, the United Nations created World Children's Day—observed every November 20—to celebrate kids worldwide and to promote their welfare.

Perhaps you can recall picking out shapes and pictures in the clouds as they drifted by when you were young. Why not turn that fuzzy feeling into action and find out how you can help build a better future for children. Just like watching clouds, all you need is a little imagination.
